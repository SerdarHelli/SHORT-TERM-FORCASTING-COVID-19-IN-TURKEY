SHORT-TERM-FORECASTING-COVID-19-IN-TURKEY BY USING LSTM WITH WITH TO COMPARE ARIMA, HWAAS, PROPHET 

LSTMs model has three different schemas: the u1schema, the u2 schema, and the u3 schema. The u1 schema is the diagram that we use in order to estimate the number of total cases for one day. In the u1 schema, the input data is based on 30 days between 24 March 2020 and 8 May 2020. The total number of cases in Turkey is used to estimate the next day results in the u1 schemaThe u2 schema is the chart that we use to estimate the next fifteen days. In the u2 schema, 24 March 2020 - 23 April 2020, the number of confirmed cases for thirty days in Turkey has been used as input data. The u3 schema is the schema that we use to estimate the next fifteen days. .In the u3 schema, 24 March 2020 - 23 April 2020, the total number of confirmed cases and deaths for thirty days in Turkey has been used as input data. Also, we have used the ARIMA model(6,1,0), Prophet, Holt-Winter’s Additive Model with Damped Trend in order to compare with the LSTMs model. In the second and third schemas, ARIMA (6,1,0), Prophet, and Holt-Winters Additive Model with Damped Trend are models that we use to estimate the next fifteen days.  In these models,  24 March 2020 - 23 April 2020, the total number of cases for thirty days in Turkey has been used as input data.
